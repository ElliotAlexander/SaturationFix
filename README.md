# SaturationFix
A bukkit plugin depending on ScenarioManager to fix 1.7 saturation. Built on ScenarioManager (https://github.com/Elllzman619/ScenarioManager). 

To install, add the .jar tp /plugins/ as normal and enable using the command tree defined by ScenarioManager. The ScenarioManager readme.md file has  more information on this.

Acts as a simple toggle for Audicy's original SaturationFix plugin (https://github.com/UltraSoftcore/SaturationFix).
